        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>The saving plans are basically investments into Government of Pakistan Market Treasury Bills. These are
                issued
                in tenure/duration of:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Months – 84 Days</li>
                <li>6 Months – 184 Days</li>
                <li>12 Months – 365 Days</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You can buy these treasuries from the AKDSL IPS Portal at anytime and generate returns in excess of the
                rate on
                savings deposits with a minimum investment amount of PKR 5,000.</li>
            <li>One of the key benefits of these investments are that they can be cashed out at any time 5 days before
                the
                scheduled
                maturity of your plan according to your convenience.</li>
